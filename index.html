            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <div class="faq-content">
                <div class="faq-row">
                    <div class="faq-question">Why wouldn't I just hire a traditional consultancy?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Time-to-value, flexibility, and affordability are our key advantages.</p>
                        <p>Time-to-value: Traditional consultancies can take months on contract negotiations and statements of work. We start working with you as soon as you subscribe, meaning we can deliver dashboards to you much faster.</p>
                        <p>Flexibility: You’re not tied in to long-term contracts, you can simply pause or cancel your subscription at any point - no questions asked. You’re also not locked into specific statements of work,  so you can add to and reprioritise your development backlog as you see fit without having to worry about renegotiating contracts or arguing about additional costs.</p>
                        <p>Affordability: Senior BI developers are typically billed at £1.5k - £2k per day by traditional consulting firms, or around £30k - £40k per month. Whilst big corporate clients may not flinch at that, it's a huge investment for growing companies. Our subscription model is built to offer unrivalled value for money to startups and SMEs.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-row">
                    <div class="faq-question">What sort of data projects do you typically work on?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Most of our work is typically straightforward dashboard development. You've got data that needs to be visualised, an idea of what you'd like to get from that data, and we build the solutions in Power BI or Tableau that deliver these insights to your users.</p>
                        <p>But we've also worked on dashboard UX makeovers, automating data flows, designing and building data models, data analysis, and data strategy.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-row">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do you connect to our data?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>However you want us to connect to your data!</p>
                        <p>Usually, clients will provide a username, password and license for us to access their Tableau or Power BI environments directly. But we can also work from standalone spreadsheets or CSV files, build a dashboard locally, and send you back the pbix or twb file for you to publish yourself. It's very much project dependent, so we're happy to be flexible to however you'd like to work.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-row">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do I send project requests?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Once you have subscribed to one of our plans, we send you a link to a shared Trello board where we will manage your project backlog. Within your board, you can submit project requests via our development request template, share Google docs or wireframes, upload links to spreadsheets, or even record a brief Loom video to talk us through your project requirements.</p>
                        <p>All we need to know is the purpose of the dashboard, specific KPIs and metrics you need to see, and how to connect to your data. As long as this information is captured or linked to within Trello, we can start working on it.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-row">
                    <div class="faq-question">What if I only have a single project request?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>That's absolutely fine. You can pause your subscription once the project is finished, and return when you have another project lined up. Easy!</p>

                        <p>We'll continue working on a dashboard until you are 100% satisfied with the results. And once you're happy, we can move onto the next item in your project backlog.</p>

                        <p>We work totally async, so there won't be another daily standup in your diary to worry about. All comms will be through the shared Trello board, where you can track progress, add comments, and send feedback. Of course, if there is a need to jump on a call at any point, we're happy to accommodate that too.</p>
